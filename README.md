## Recommended Tool

We generaly use the [PF2 Monster Builder](http://monster.pf2.tools/) to create NPCs and Monsters. This uses JSON, PNG and PDF files, that can be easily imported/exported. 

This repository holds those files publicly sourced and created, as well as other tools/files.  

## No Copyright Materials

Please do not submit PDF files or entire texts, or any images or maps from the AP. Only submit modifications necessary to convert to 2E, such as the DCs and 2E builds of NPCs/Monsters/Hazards/Items plus XP and 2E level based treasure. Please include a location number or name for each encounter or item so GMs can cross-reference with the original scenario.
